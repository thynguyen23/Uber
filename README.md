- Before analyzing I need to clean,check for missing values
- After that is Exploratory Data Analysis
 + Firstly, Asking
Some question I will answer:
      Check how long do people travel with Uber?
      What Hour Do Most People Take Uber To Their Destination?
      Check The Purpose Of Trips
      Which Day Has The Highest Number Of Trips
      What Are The Number Of Trips Per Each Day?
      What Are The Trips In The Month
  + Secondly, Cleaning 
  + Thirdly, Explore Data
