-Before analyzing the data, it is important to perform data cleaning and check for missing values.
-Once the data is cleaned, the next step is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
+Firstly, ask relevant questions that need to be answered, such as:
How long do people typically travel with Uber?
What hour do most people take Uber to their destination?
What is the purpose of the trips?
Which day has the highest number of trips?
How many trips are there for each day?
How are the trips distributed across the month?
+Secondly, perform any necessary cleaning steps to ensure data quality and consistency.
+Thirdly, explore the data by analyzing and summarizing key statistics, trends, and patterns.
+Next, visualize the data using charts, graphs, and other visualizations to gain insights and communicate findings effectively.
+Finally, share the findings and insights with stakeholders, such as presenting the results in a report or presentation format.
In this project, Python is the primary programming language used for data analysis. Additionally, PostgreSQL is used for data storage, and there is a connection established between Python and PostgreSQL for seamless data integration and analysis.
